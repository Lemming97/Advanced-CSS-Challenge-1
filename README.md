<br>An effective portfolio of work to showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.
<br>When a user loads their portfolip they should be presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
<br>When a user clicks one of the links in the navigation they should expect the UI to scroll to the corresponding section.
<br>When a user clicks on the link to the section about their work they should expect the UI scroll to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
<br>When a user is presented with the developer's first application they should see that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
<br>When a user clicks on the images of the applications they should be taken to that deployed application.
<br>When a user resizes the page or view the site on various screens and devices they should be presented with a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
